# Add users

A simple application that I created to learn React.js, in this application I practiced the following topics:
- Reusable components
- State management
- Props
- Conditional rendering
- CSS modules

This app allows you to add and delete items from a list, also can handle some input errors.

# Usage

Clone this repository, open the terminal on the root directory and run the following commands:
```
// install all required dependencies
npm install

// run the app
npm start
```
